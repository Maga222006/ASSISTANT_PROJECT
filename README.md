# ASSISTANT PROJECT

A powerful AI assistant project designed to help users with various tasks.

## Description

This project implements an AI-powered assistant capable of handling various user requests and tasks efficiently, with support for parallel task execution.

## Features

- AI-powered responses
- Task automation
- Natural language processing
- Interactive communication
- Multi-threaded task execution
- Parallel tool processing for improved performance
- Concurrent request handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maga222006/ASSISTANT_PROJECT.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd ASSISTANT_PROJECT
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The assistant supports parallel execution of tasks using multiple threads:

```python
# Example of parallel tool execution
assistant.run_tools_parallel([
    "tool1",
    "tool2",
    "tool3"
])
```

This allows for efficient processing of multiple tasks simultaneously, significantly reducing execution time for complex operations.

## Deployment
